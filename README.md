## INTRODUCTION
Java is a programming language created by james Gosling and Sun Microsystems (later bought by Oracle) 
its syntax is similar to C and C++
java add features like thread management, remote execution,etc.
the java code once compiled can be transported and executed in any cpu as long as this cpu suport JVM 
java is POO (object-oriented programming)
An object is a collection of variables (information) and the way to manipulate this information (the methods).
A Class is the prototype that defines the variables and methods, It is the abstract definition of what later becomes an object in memory
Every class or object internally consists of constructors, fields, and/or methods
field are elements that holds information related to the class.
methods are element that allows manipulating the information of the fields.
constructor is an element that allows reserving memory to store the fields and methods of the Class when creating an object of the same.

Concept of inheritance and polymorphism
with inheritance,we can define a class based on another existing class, so that the new class will have all the variables and methods of the class it is created from, plus any new variables and methods it needs.

Access Modifiers
Both classes and ther elements can be modified by acccess modifiers we have three types of modifiers
private: the element is only accessible within the class it is in
protected: the element is only accessible from the class it is in, as well as from subclasses that inherit from that class
public: the element is accessible from any class.

Class , abstract class and interface.
In a class, when definig one methods, we would have to implement the code
for the method, the subclasses that inherit from superclass would not have to implement these methods unless they want
In an abstrac class, we could implement the methods that interest us and leave the rest unimplemented (as abstract methods). these methods would need to be implemented in the child classes.
In an interface, we cannot implement any methods in the parent class, and each child class has to provide its ows implementation of the methods.
